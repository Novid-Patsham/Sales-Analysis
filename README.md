# Sales-Analysis

#### In this project I analyze and answer business questions related to about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. I make use of matplotlib to visualize the results of the questions.
